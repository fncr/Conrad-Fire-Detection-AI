# Fire Detection AI
I am working with a raspberry pi that will feed a live video stream into a machine learning model that returns and determines whether there is a fire in the raspberry pi's FOV

# Final Milestone
By the end of this project I want to be able to put the raspberry pi and a camera on a drone that can fly around and find fires, and even determine the class of fire.

# Second Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# First Milestone
I set up the raspberry pi and was able to run python scripts and tensor flow. I was also able to use NanoNets to develop a model that can detect fires.
